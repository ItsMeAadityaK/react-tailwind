1. Created a new React app using `npx create-react-app my-tailwind-app`.
2. Navigated into the project folder with `cd my-tailwind-app`.
3. Installed Tailwind CSS and its dependencies using `npm install -D tailwindcss@3.3.5 postcss autoprefixer`.
4. Ran `npx tailwindcss init -p` to generate the configuration files.
5. Edited `tailwind.config.js` to include the paths for all source files.
6. Added Tailwindâ€™s directives (`@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, `@tailwind utilities`) into `index.css`.
7. Updated `App.js` to use Tailwind classes and display a simple styled message.
8. Started the development server with `npm start` to verify that Tailwind CSS was working properly.
